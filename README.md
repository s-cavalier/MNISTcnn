# My MNIST Convolutional Neural Network
Serves mainly as a personal proof-of-concept for convolutions. <br>
Has a built class for performing 1D and 2D personally made fast fourier convolutions. <br>
CMatrix class still has a lot of room open for optimizations, however it is functional and learns to around 70% in one epoch. <br>

Max-pooling algorithim requires implementation for use, however, as I have developed an algorithim to compute max-pooling in `O(1)` space and `O(nm)` time complexities that I have yet to open-source.
